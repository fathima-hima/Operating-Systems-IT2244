This collection of C programs demonstrates fundamental concepts such as printing output, using variables, data types, input from users, and performing arithmetic operations. Key
Using #include <stdio.h> to enable input/output functions like printf() and scanf().
Understanding format specifiers (%d, %lf, %c) for printing different data types correctly.
Initializing and assigning values to variables, including multiple variables and updating values.
Handling uninitialized variables can lead to unpredictable output.
Using the sizeof operator to determine the memory size of data types.
Printing floating-point numbers with specified decimal precision.
Reading input safely, including handling newline characters before %c in scanf.
Performing arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with casting for float division), and modulus.
Checking for division by zero before performing division or modulus to avoid runtime errors.
These examples provide a foundational understanding of basic C programming concepts essential for further learning and application development.
